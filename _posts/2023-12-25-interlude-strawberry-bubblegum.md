title: "Strawberry Bubblegum"
---
*Open on the streets of Blue Arcadia, outside the arena. A few synths are meandering in and out of the building, and a few cafes have popped up around the grounds. We're above the head of the crowd, but as we gradually pan down, one figure stands out-- a person of indeterminate gender with red hair and an equally red lab coat. Actually a person, even-- flesh tones are highly unusual. They pause outside the arena, then look up at a banner for "Coming Soon: Final Fantasy 7".*

* LAB COAT: (...The hell do they mean by that?)

*With a serious, thoughtful look, they head inside.*

*On the arena floor, Exime is signing up other synths for a skirmish-- behind her, in the distance, a synth gets thrown across the arena with an excited squeal, into a fighting polygon. Magus, meanwhile, has set up a stage against one wall of the arena. A cherry-red synth with a full-face visor is staring firmly at a script, several others lined up next to them.*

* CHERRY SYNTH: Behold! Press forward, and rendezvous with the leader of our fair squadron!
* MAGUS: No, no, just read it like I wrote it! Gah, they might have plays here, but their tastes are so *weird...*

*In frustration, he scans the arena floor, and looks shocked at the sight of a new humanoid-- this is the first one he's seen since setting up shop here, after all! On his way pushing through the crowd, he casually shoves his datapad into Exime's hands.*

* MAGUS: Hey, hi! You new here?
* LAB COAT: Eh? I suppose, though I'm not planning to stay too long.

*Magus seems a little disappointed at this; after all, there's clearly been some culture clash between him and the synths up until now. Still, he nods.*

* MAGUS: Well, while you're here, welcome to the Arena, uh...?
* LAB COAT: Doctor Okazaki.
* MAGUS: Right, pleasure to meet you! We use a bunch of outer-world data to simulate exciting fights, and--
* DR OKAZAKI: Oh? So they're just simulations.
* MAGUS: I, uh...

*Magus glances around, then gestures for the newbie to follow him.*

*Cut to one of the back rooms of the arena, a storage room having been very hastily converted into an office. There's a desk made out of several crates pushed together, with translucent datapads piled up like very thick, faintly-glowing paper. Magus shuts the door, then walks over to sit on the edge of the desk.*

* MAGUS: Why are you interested in whether or not they're simulations?
* Doctor Okazaki folds their arms, stepping deeper into the room.
* DR OKAZAKI: Because, for roughly the last six years, dimensional travel has been effectively impossible. And I've spent most of that time trying to figure out why.
* Magus exhales, rubbing his forehead, above his mechanical visor.
* MAGUS: I had a feeling it wasn't just the old arena. You think something's... wrong with timespace, or something?
* DR OKAZAKI: Unfortunately, I was hoping *you* might know. ...Especially considering how much power I had to burn to even jump *here*.
* MAGUS: Well, it was definitely gradual. People stopped showing up a little at a time, until there was just nothing left. I do have a prototype, I'm calling it the hole-punch, but... Marlow says she wants to approve every use of it. Says it's risky. And I mean, she's probably right, but if something's wrong on *this* scale, I think it's riskier to just sit around and wait to see what happens, you know?
* DR OKAZAKI: Interesting. And Marlow is...?
* MAGUS: Basically head administrator of the city. Real hardass. She always wants to meet the newbies, so if you stick around here, she'll probably hunt you down sooner or later.
* DR OKAZAKI: ...I suppose I *will* be sticking around for a bit, then. Until I can get her to authorize an experiment with your "hole-punch," anyway.
* MAGUS: Well, you're welcome to hang around here! You aren't gonna find anyone more knowledgeable on Blue Arcadia tech than Loa, I guarantee it.
* DR OKAZAKI: [thoughtfully, carefully nods] I suppose so. Pleasure to meet you, then, Magus. [They start to leave.]
* MAGUS: [startled] How do you know my name?!
* DR OKAZAKI: ...You have posters with your face all over the arena.
* MAGUS: Oh. Right. Those.
* DR OKAZAKI: Quite. [lifts a hand, as if to casually wave, resuming walking out]
* MAGUS: Hey, while you're here... You ever acted?

*Doctor Okazaki pauses.*

* DR OKAZAKI: What, like, for a camera?
* MAGUS: Well, it'd be more on-stage in this case. But we need warm bodies some kinda fierce, and a lot of the material in this just kinda blows over the heads of these synths. The culture here is... very insular, and that's made all their own plays really self-referential. None of them *get* what I'm going for, you know?

*They turn back towards Magus, their eyes sparkling.*

* DR OKAZAKI: Well, if I'm going to be stuck here for a bit anyway... I'm listening.

Goooood evening heroes! This is Magus Overture, and we're going to start off the first battle of XSYS with a real double-barreled *bang*.

See, my original plan was just to smoke-test the system, have you all rack up some damage on a sandbag-- essentially a hologram, patterned after something I saw once back home. But the more I think about all this little guy's been through, I think he deserves to stand a chance.

And I think he deserves a little revenge.

This Friday, you'll be fighting:

![Sandbag, from Super Smash Bros, with a shotgun. And angry eyebrows.](/assets/images/2023-06-28-sandbagsrevenge.png)

What's more, he won't just stand there and take it. Each turn, he'll summon new Targets to hide behind. You'll need to swiftly break the targets to pierce through to the squishy sandbag behind!

You can use !fullclass Sandbag and !fullclass Target in the system channels for more information. Remember, the battle starts this Friday at 7 PM Central time, so be there, or, uh, be somewhere else!

Okay, that oughta be good. How do I turn this thing off? No, stop recording. Stop. Stop. Disable. Remove. Undo. Is it this butto--

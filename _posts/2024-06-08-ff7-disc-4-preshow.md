You've already seen the story, at the end of the last recap.

To close out Final Fantasy 7, you're headed to the moon, to stop whatever Sephiroth's put into motion! But in order to get there, you're going to need to punch through the waves of monsters falling from its surface.

This is going to be another Rush Battle, like the train sequence all the way back on Disc 1. You'll have some support from Aeris, but you'll also have a lot of enemies to clear out! And once you wipe them out, you'll still have to deal with what awaits you on the moon...

...the eldest and most powerful of primals, Jenova.

Time is of the essence! Be ready to break through, at 7 PM tonight!

Hey, heroes! This is Magus Overture, with an exciting new feature announcement!

You might be asking, what are we gonna do if we can't get turnout one night? I get it, sometimes you get into a scooter accident down by the bay and you just can't make it over in time.

Patch 1.0.2 includes Supporters! These are special units that join battle, and *don't take regular turns*. Instead, they *grant every ally access to some special moves*. Think of them like an assist character for everyone on the team, making the rest of you that much more awesome!

Our arena staff has kindly volunteered to take to the field and support you whenever necessary.

Check out the [Supporters page](/system/supporters) for more information! And see you soon for the next fight!

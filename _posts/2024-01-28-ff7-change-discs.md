*Open on the docks, late in the evening; a grey sea crashes against unflinching steel structures. Wild angular ship designs rest in uneven docking spaces; some are small and take after hypothetical sea life, others are like massive battleships, but with maybe only a single large cannon at most. Weapons are broadly unseen here. The outline of Big Dendy's massive hull is in the very back of the shot, if you squint.*

*Doctor Okazaki's bright red hair draws the eye straight to her-- she walks into frame in front of a different ship. The others are anchored in place; this one's moving with the waves, rocking up and down. It's made of brass and dark iron, four massive gears (one on each diagonal) acting vaguely like wings.*

*Someone in an oil-stained jumpsuit jumps from the ship and just barely lands on the dock, walking up to Doctor Okazaki. Marlow (the city's administrator), Magus (the ref), and Loa (the tech-synth assisting with the arena) are also here, standing behind Doctor Okazaki.*

* OIL-STAINED TECHNICIAN: Well, Doc--
* DR OKAZAKI: [cutting them off] Okazaki. Doctor Okazaki.

*The technician raises an eyebrow, but doesn't comment on it.*

* MARLOW: So this is it, then? The ship that took you from your world to ours?
* DR OKAZAKI: Such as it is, yes. I was hoping to be able to make a return trip, but... How's it looking?
* OIL-STAINED TECHNICIAN: Right now? We can't even get this thing out of the water.
* LOA: Oh? That's no problem! I can ask Big Dendy, we can probably fabricate any parts you need--
* Marlow claps her hands, a flash of light from the impact point drawing everyone's attention.
* MARLOW: If we repair this ship, what exactly are its capabilities?
* DR OKAZAKI: [off-guard] Ah... we can jump to other worlds, but it's pretty much blind for the moment.
* MARLOW: I will not permit Blue Arcadia technology to be used in the creation of a world-jumping device.
* This seems to surprise the whole group.
* MARLOW: I won't assist you. And neither will anyone in this city.
* Magus in particular folds his arms, seeming only an inch from blurting out something like "make me," but he's biting his tongue for the moment.
* MARLOW: Loa, seize their device.
* LOA: Uh, um, ma'am, I'm not sure if you've noticed, but it's a bespoke device in a bespoke vehicle with controls from *another world*. I have no idea how to do that.
* DR OKAZAKI: ...May I ask why?
* MARLOW: ...I suppose. I'd like you to look at something.

*Marlow gestures out towards the city of Blue Arcadia, close against the shore. Lights in buildings are starting to kick on as dusk settles in.*

* MARLOW: You're both newcomers to Blue Arcadia. Loa, would you explain what this shoreline was like ten years ago?

*Loa hesitates, but doesn't want to reject an order from the city's administrator. He puts up a hologram, and the skyscrapers disappear; there's just a few cracked domes, and the earth is torn up between them.*

* MARLOW: Blue Arcadia is *my* creation. Before I started brokering treaties and organizing rules, most synth creations were weapons, and any meaningful infrastructure got destroyed within a few days. Now, thanks to the hard work of every synth, we finally have a sustainable society here. But the one thing I've learned is that it is far, *far* easier to destroy something than to build it.
* Marlow pauses.
* MARLOW: What I say next... may not make sense to all of you. ...Every story needs a villain. For a story to be compelling, a villain must be more powerful than their hero. And that villain is designed to fit within their story.
* Loa and the technician are looking at each other, befuddled. Doctor Okazaki seems at the edge of comprehending, but Magus gets there first, snapping his fingers.
* MAGUS: And if a villain broke loose from their story, got this kind of device, this kind of power...
* Marlow nods sternly.
* MARLOW: The result would be cataclysmic. Destruction. A war of conquest, across countless worlds. And all it would take would be *one* of these devices falling into the wrong hands.
* MAGUS: I mean, but that's only if there's a small number of these devices! World-travel *used* to be easy, and it wasn't a problem, because someone could just bring them back, like the group of heroes you have in your own city--
* MARLOW: [suddenly irritable] And what are those innocent people supposed to do in the meantime? I've put too much work into this place, into these synths and their lives. I won't see it lost because *someone* didn't know how to leave well enough alone. Loa, figure out how to destroy this ship. Immediately.
* LOA: Um... yes, ma'am...
* DR OKAZAKI: Hold on! ...I'll assist you in removing the world-jumping device, if you'll help us repair the ship.
* MARLOW: ...Acceptable. Loa, see to it that they stick to these terms.

*Marlow walks off down the dock, leaving Loa and the technician to start talking details. Magus pursues Marlow, and catches up to her near the shoreline.*

* MAGUS: Hey. HEY. Marlow.
* MARLOW: [turning, annoyed] What?
* MAGUS: Look, I've been nice about this, because I want the arena to be a positive thing for the city, so I put the hole-punch on hold. And you've got Doctor Okazaki pinned down, so of *course* she has to agree. But you can't really expect this to hold, right?
* MARLOW: What's your point? I've addressed the problems this city has faced.
* MAGUS: This is clearly proof that even if *you* don't go outside, other people will. There are absolutely other people in other worlds working on this tech right now, and we're just the first ones to wind up *here*. Are you just going to stick your head in the sand and pretend--
* MARLOW: I'm not an idiot, Magus. But I will certainly not contribute to making the problem worse. And I will defend this city from *anyone* who threatens it, if necessary.
* MAGUS: [sarcastically amused] With what? When someone shows up with a planet-killer capital ship, how are you going to stop them?
* MARLOW: [silently smug] ...The same way I put a stop to the synths' fighting. With my fists.

*Marlow snaps her fingers and instantly vanishes, leaving Magus standing there alone, frustrated.*

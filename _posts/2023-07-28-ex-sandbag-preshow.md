Goooood evening heroes! For those of you who didn't make it to the first flight, or those of you who didn't get your fill-- I'm introducing Remix Battles! These take an earlier boss and add a little twist, just to see what happens.

This week's fight iiiiis:

![Sandbag, from Super Smash Bros, with a shotgun. And angry eyebrows.](/assets/images/2023-07-28-ex-sandbag.png)

That's right-- it's "EX Sandbag... With TWO Shotguns"!

The core of the fight is the same: you'll need to break through the Targets it summons each turn and damage the Sandbag behind. But this one hits harder! It gains Power Up at the start of each turn with *no* condition, it gets a free shot at whoever breaks each target, and in a pinch, it has the legendary skill Off Waves!

...And, on top of that, I *did* remove the CT damage on Chaingun, so you'll have to work a lot harder to keep it pinned down this time.

You can use !class EX Sandbag and !class Target in the system channels for more information. Remember, the battle starts this Saturday at 7 PM Central time, so make sure you're ready for the brawl!

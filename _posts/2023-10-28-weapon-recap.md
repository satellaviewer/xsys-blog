Heroes: Rue (Wrathguard), Herringway (Arbiter), Dragoshi (Decider), Lana (Decider), Misty (Arcanimist), Amara (Sharker)

You're not counting wrong-- that's six heroes! I didn't want to make anyone drop, so I figured I'd let it roll and see what happens.

I was expecting to need to bulk out the hero team, so I'd prepared Supporters to leap in... but instead, I had Loa jump in on the side of the boss, providing an extra TP to the Altima Weapon! But, Herringway was able to keep summoning high-Tactical callcards to hit for -1 TP, keeping it pinned down and unable to benefit from it. Lana, in her first fight, also punched STRAIGHT through Big Fat Tacoma with a single carefully-planned HSD Railgun shot.

The fight ran a little slower, with this many people packed into the arena, but that wasn't too much of a problem. It pushed about half an hour past the official end of the battle, but by the time it got a turn to use its, uh, altimate skill, the party had their Limit Breaks ready-- and they used them to rush it down, knocking it out before its attack could resolve!

...Sure, Submerge was broken, but we'll have that fixed by next time.

I awarded 250 pyroxene, 250 tomestones, and 1000 nuyen for the victory. See you all next month for a new battle! This one might be a little bit bitter, or a little bit sweet...

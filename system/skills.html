        </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong><span class="fg1 bg09">Artisan Studies</span> (Red Science):</strong> <em>You pen letters and essays in the language of flame.</em> You can hold sigils in your mind: base accuracy (not including brackets), base power, element, damage type (not including healing), a single tag, or targeting. While you hold more than three sigils in your mind, gain indefinite Burn status. </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong><span class="fg8 bg01">Sketch</span> (Red Science):</strong> <em>Steal inspiration, and capture part of the essence of a skill in your mind.</em> Once per turn, when a skill is used, you can copy any single sigil from it. If the skill is targeting you, Sketch's cooldown doesn't apply. (Sigil copying is evaluated after applying all other modifiers. You can't both Sketch and Inscribe or Write the same skill.) </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong>Judgement (Red Science):</strong> 85%, M40. <em>Write "to become fire rather than be burned" in the Correspondence, and produce a radiant blast of golden light. The only <strong>truly</strong> universal language is power.</em> For each sigil applied, increase total power by 15. (1E, 1 TP) </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong>Red Medicine (Red Science):</strong> [100%], H40. <em>Shroud the target in soothing darkness and write the Correspondence for "everything in its place," declaring that their wounds shall heal.</em> For each sigil applied, add a target or increase base power by 20. (1+A, 1 TP) </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong>Write (Red Science):</strong> <em>Weave multiple sigils into deep and subtle meaning. You're both scientist and scholar, after all.</em> Apply any number of held sigils to your next skill. Can be used multiple times per turn. (0 TP) </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong>Leaden Study (Red Science):</strong> <em>Engrave a sigil onto a special tablet. Just the one, mind-- even lead can burn.</em> Converts a held sigil into a Tablet containing that sigil. Tablets can be passed to other fighters, or used by Correspondents like any other sigil. Once per turn, fighters without Write can use a single Tablet alongside any skill for 0 TP. (1 TP) </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong><span class="fg8 bg01">Inscribe</span> (Red Science):</strong> [75%]. <em>Release a sigil at the perfect moment, overwriting their reality with yours.</em> Forcibly write a single held sigil onto someone else's skill, as they use it. If successful, this consumes the held sigil, and replaces the equivalent base value on the target skill for this use. </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong><span class="fg0 bg04">Red Miracle</span> (Red Science):</strong> <em>You need no <strong>permission</strong> from physics or nature. Write what now shall be, and force the world to comply.</em> Gain the Red Miracle status: you don't take the Burn status from holding too many sigils, Inscribe becomes [100%], and Inscribe can write multiple sigils onto the same skill. </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong><span class="fg0 bg04">Law of the Void</span> (Red Science):</strong> <em>Engrave a blazing law upon the field.</em> Write a law that all units must follow until the end of battle; ref gets final say on what's permissible. If anyone violates the law, they take a M60 attack. You may change the law as a 0 TP action. </div>
            <div class="skill"><strong><span class="fg9 bg01">Boosted CT</span> (Hero Property):</strong> <em>Heroes are always the best at what they do.</em> At the end of your turns, receive between 1 and 20 extra CT. </div>

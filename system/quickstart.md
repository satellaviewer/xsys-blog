# How to Play

## How to Sign Up
* Use "!register".
* To change your display name, use "!name".
* To change the colors of your display name, use "!colors 1 0".
* If you want to authorize another IRC nick or Discord account as your alias:
	* Make sure you're already on a nick the bot recognizes as you.
	* For an IRC nick, use "!alias [nick]".
	* For a Discord account, use "!alias [user ID]". The user ID should be an 18-digit number-- you can find it by clicking your avatar, then selecting "Copy User ID".

## On Battle Night
1. Pick a class.
	* If you're new, try the Profaner (an all-offense dark-magic wielder) or the Bouncer (a high-flying evasive offense class)!
	* You can view each class's skills on the [Skills page](skills.html).
2. Pick a Groove.
	* If you're not sure, pick H-Groove!
3. Join with "!enter Main Class/Groove".
	* If you have secondary classes or auxiliaries unlocked, you can use "!enter Main Class/Secondary Class/Auxiliary/Groove" to specify those.
4. On your turn, pick 3 TP worth of actions.
	* Most actions are 1 TP. Some are 0 TP "free" actions.
	* You can't use the same action multiple times in the same turn, unless it specifically says you can.
	* Even if you're Downed, you can still fight!
5. When it's not your turn, you can:
	* Call your Reaction (the black/yellow skill), when the condition is met
	* Call your Interrupt (the black/white skill), at the start of any other player's turn

## Between Battles
For now, you can...
* View your currencies with !money and !px.
* Play the !slots with your nuyen.

## 1.0-RC1 (June 17, 2023)
Patch 1.0-RC1, "A Ref Reborn," is now live! This patch introduces the eight starting classes: the attack classes Profaner, Bouncer, Scion, and Decider, and the support classes Arcanimist, Wrathguard, Arbiter, and Correspondent.

This patch is just focused on core battling. Things not in this patch include: spending currency, secondaries/auxiliaries, item inventories, hazards, surges. (There's a !slots machine, though.)

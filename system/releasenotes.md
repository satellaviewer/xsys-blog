# Release Notes

## 1.0-RC3
* Added formal definition for a skill being "canceled," as seen in one of Wrathguard's reactions.
* After testing, nerfed the *hell* out of stat-mod statuses, both in raw power (0.5 shifts / 5 points per level, down from 3 shifts / 30 points per level) and calculation (now additive rather than ratio based on defense). ...Look, this let someone in an optimal situation deal *ten times base damage*. It was clearly gonna be a problem.

## 1.0-RC2 (June 28, 2023)
* The basic skill *Wait* is now always 50 CT, to patch a potential rules issue involving repeated turn-start events.
* The basic skill *Brace* has been added.
* The Profaner now gains 90 Antiphoton on kill, down from 250 (a full gauge).

## 1.0-RC1 (June 17, 2023)
Patch 1.0-RC1, "A Ref Reborn," is now live! This patch introduces the eight starting classes: the attack classes Profaner, Bouncer, Scion, and Decider, and the support classes Arcanimist, Wrathguard, Arbiter, and Correspondent.

This patch is just focused on core battling. Things not in this patch include: spending currency, secondaries/auxiliaries, item inventories, hazards, surges. (There's a !slots machine, though.)
